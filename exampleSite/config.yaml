      I am an IT Consulting, and MSP Vetern with over 15 years of Professional services Experiance, ranging from small single seat clients, to 1000+ seat multi-national companies, non-profits, and financial institions, education, and everything inbetween.

      I live by the Motto "Make future me less unhappy" Which professionally means, ensuring the solutions I impliment today, wont end up becoming tomorrow's technical debt.  It is also why I am so dedicated to creating functiona living documentation, typicaly utilizing a dedicated IT documentation tool, such as ITGlue, Hudu, or more recently ITFlow. This leads me to building templates and playbooks that are easy to follow, and take into account the varied skill levels of those utilizing them, to facilate up-skilling, and de-escalation of common tasks and incidents.
