## Who I am

I am a Human first and foremost, what this means for me, is being able to balance the things that matter to me, my partner, family, friends, and personal growth and health, and the things that matter professionally.  This has lead me back to Consulting from Managed services, and allowed me to take the time to be able to recenter and pursue what makes future me less unhappy - removing obstacles, blockers, and spending quality time with my partner. I addition to being a Human, in no particular order, I have been and/or also:
- A Partner
- A Care Giver
- A Cook
- A Forager and Wildcrafter
- A Fermenter of various food stuffs
- A Parent of adult children and Pets
- A Teacher, Trainer, and Coach of adults and children
- An OpenSource Contributor
- A Business Owner
- A Music and B Grade Movie lover
- An Artist and Wood Carver
- A Technician and Technologist
- A Person with non-visible Disabilities
- A Friend and Ally

## Caregiving and Disability

In addition to being an Indigenous professional I am also a fulltime caregiver for my partner, as we both have various disabilities. Being a caregiver is one of the reasons why I have been pursuing contracting and fractional services, as they grant me the flexibility that is not typically afforded to FTE staffs.  For us the disabilities we deal with have lead us to leave the city, and move out the interior's country side, where we are able to remove ourselves from the myriad of stimuli that aggregate our conditions. That said one of the major stimuli we are required to avoid and minimize is chemical particulates, perticularly present in scented products, as these cause a very strong and life threatening reaction.  In addition to this we both suffer from connective tissue disorders which also require modifications to our living arrangements.

## Indigenous History

I am a Non-Status Indian of the Kitsumkalum band of the Tsimshian Nation on my mothers side, and an undetermined ancestry though my paternal grandmother. With that said, I grew up separated from those roots, and it has taken me moving from the busy south coast of BC to Interior of BC to start to realize and appreciate my ancestry. In the last few years I have had the time to see and connect more with my roots, and have started working towards providing services and opportunities to the community.  While I am rather inexperienced in traditional ways I do have a keen respect for the land and the cycles it contains, after all if the area you live cannot support life, it cannot support yourself, which one of the many reason we moved from the big city out into the country side.
