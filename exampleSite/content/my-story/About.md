## Who I am

I am a Human first and foremost, what this means for me, is being able to balance the things that matter to me, my partner, family, friends, and personal growth and health, and the things that matter professionally.  This has lead me back to Consulting from Managed services, and allowed me to take the time to be able to recenter and pursue what makes future me less unhappy.  In addition to all of this, I am also:
 - A Partner
 - A Care Giver
 - A Cook
 - A Parent of adult children and Pets
 - A Teacher, Trainer, and Coach of adults and children
 - An OpenSource Contributor
 - A Business Owner
 - A Consultant, Technical Implementor, and Solution Designer
 - A Music and B Grade Movie lover
 - An Artist and Wood Carver
 - A Technician and Technologist
 - A Person with Invisible Disabilities
 - A Friend and Ally

## Caregiving and Disability

 In addition to everything else, I am a Caregiver, and Disabled myself, between my partner and I we have had to make a variety of changes to our daily lives to limit the impact of our disabilities.  All of these modifications to our lives has led to my move back to Consulting and Fractional work, as this allows for the flexibility to remove barriers and take the time required to properly give care, and take care of myself.  One of the biggest modifications required was for me to limit the amount of time spent in settings such as offices, as one of the biggest triggers for my partner is chemical particulates mostly commonly found in scented products, and the Respiratory Distress that they trigger, as well as shared food sensitivities. With the requirement to increase Isolation to control the particulates that cause this reaction, we moved from the Vancouver Region, and moved out to the Rural Kootenays of BCâ€™s interior; this afforded us more control of the environment - less cars, neighbours, their dryer sheets, the ability to install a whole house air filtration system, among other controls.  With the constant triggers of the office lifestyle and condensed townhouse living behind us, our mutual health improved, trips to the ER drastically decreased from every 6 weeks, to once a year. Those are only part of the caregiving and disability story, we both have connective tissue issues, in particular I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome or EDS, which has led to the need to consistently devote time and expense to improving the ergonomics of our workspaces.  With all that said, even with all the dedication put towards reducing and eliminating barriers to continued focused work, the flexibility offered by Consulting and Fractional work is something that I am grateful for.

## Indigenous History

I am a Non-Status Indian of the Kitsumkalum band of the Tsimshian Nation on my mothers side, and an undetermined ancestry though my paternal grandmother. With that said, I grew up separated from those roots, and it has taken me moving from the busy south coast of BC to Interior of BC to start to realize and appreciate my ancestry. In the last few years I have had the time to see and connect more with my roots, and have started working towards providing services and opportunities to the community.  While I am rather inexperienced in traditional ways I do have a keen respect for the land and the cycles it contains; after all if the area you live cannot support life, it cannot support yourself, which one of the many reason we moved from the big city out into the country side.  While I say I have been disconnected from my roots, and am learning how to reconnect, I have been taught how to create traditional Coast Salish wood carvings by Walter Stoochnoff, and have even made my own wood carving tools.  At the time I never really understood the significance of the education, only with the Lens of time have I learned how precious that time and education is.

## Open Source

I have been involved in the Open Source Community for 20 years - since the I got a second computer that could boot Linux, back in 2004, and started with Gentoo based Sabayon Linux 3.4. While I am primarily a user, I also provide small contributions, and user support to a variety of projects. In recent years my time available to Open Source initiatives has been low, however I am planning become more active again, especially as tooling and utilities have matured, with instances such as Traefik, and Wazuh entering the professional market, in addition to increased containerization of services.
