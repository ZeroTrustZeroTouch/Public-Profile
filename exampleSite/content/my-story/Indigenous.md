## History

I am a Non-Status Indian of the Kitsumkalum band of the Tsimshian Nation on my mothers side, and an undertermined ancestory though my paternal grandmother. With that said, I grew up seperated from those roots, and it has taken me moving from the busy south coast of BC to Interior of BC to start to realize and appriciate my ancestory. In the last few years I have had the time to see and connect more with my roots, and have started working towards providing services and oppertunities to the community.  While I am rather inexperianced in traditional ways I do have a keen respect for the land and the cycles it contains, afterall if the area you live cannot support life, it cannot support youself, which one of the many reason we moved from the big city out into the country side.
