## At Zero Trust Zero Touch we offer four broad catagories of services:
- Implimentations
- Migrations
- Moderninzation
- Consulting and Fractional Services

<hr>

## Implimentations

The services offered for Implimentations are designated as anything that is "Net New" to your organization, such as new hardware, adding in software or cloud services, or even a whole new office.

## Migrations

Migrations entail moving any type of service or offering, and is often combined with Implimentations in cases such as upgrading and replacing Server hardware, or firewalls. This also encompases migrations of cloud providers and associated services. These process are typically more involved than Implimentations, as there will be more documentation and change management processes than with net new implimentations.

## Modernization

This service is a little more nuanced than the first two, in that there will be more stakeholder engaugement to ensure all parties are able to come to an agreement on the solutions required.  Typically Moderninzations involve identifying painpoints, bottlenecks and frequent issues, the end goal being removing as many blockers and obstacles to ensure and easy and seamless experiance for your business needs.  One of the most common Modernization practices is working to enable SSO with more of your business applications to reduce the number of discrete passwords staff need to keep track of, enabling easier auditing and change management.
