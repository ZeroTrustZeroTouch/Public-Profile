## What is Zero Trust Zero Touch
We are a Remote first, Indigenous owned IT Management and Consulting Company.  We Operate under the two main principals of "Make Future Me less Unhappy" and "Human-Centric" - This means we work towards removing barriers, blockers, and generally unpleasant or annoying tasks. This means we can focus on the Humans who do the work, and make the tasks work for them, not the other way around.  This approch allows us to work with a very wide range of organizations to fit their unique needs. We leverage a variety to tools to empower teams to take back their time from mundane minutia of day to day IT management, allowing them to focus on their own initiatives.

## Why Fractional and Consulting Services
We were founded after Owner and Principal Consulting Glenn Phillips went back and forth from Traditional consulting and MSP work discovering a need for a middle ground not driven by aggressive sales pitches or relentless specializations. Instead we focus on providing a broad range of technical skills, backed with experience in working with a large variety of businesses and needs. This allows us to cut through the layers tech talk, and technology solutions to speak to the business needs that drive them, and why they're important or not.
