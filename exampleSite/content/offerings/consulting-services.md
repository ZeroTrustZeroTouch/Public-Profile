## What are Fractional Services?
Fractional Consulting is a rising trend in IT consulting where instead of hiring externally per project like with Electricians to perform a specific task, an agreement is made to internally hire part-time, effectively similar to Bookkeeping and Property Management partnerships.  This shift allows access to high level Talent, on per-initiative basis, or even on-going retainers. The key part Fractional consulting is the flexibility, for both the consultant, and for the partner.

## Why Fractional?
Zero Trust Zero Touch was founded on the ideals of "Make Future-Me Less Unhappy", and "Human-Centric".  The "Make Future Me Less Unhappy" is simply an easy way of saying: Do extra work upfront to mitigate Barriers and Blockers that actively create Unhappiness. The "Human-Centric" part comes as a byproduct of that thought process, as its not very enjoyable to treated like a Cog in a Machine, so we try and do better and treat every person and opportunity as Human first, as at the end of the day and all real work will pass through someone's hands. That has lead us to offer fractional services, so that a wider rance of organizations can benefit from highly skilled resources at a right sized capacity.
