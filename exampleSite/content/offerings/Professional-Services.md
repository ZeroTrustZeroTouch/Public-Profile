## At Zero Trust Zero Touch we offer four broad catagories of Professional services:
- Implementations
- Migrations
- Modernization
- Consulting and Fractional Services

<hr>

## Implementations

The services offered for Implementations are designated as anything that is "Net New" to your organization, such as:
- New Hardware, like servers, switches, and firewalls 
- New Software or cloud services
- Perhaps even a whole new office
This services is offered a sliding scale starting at $100/hour and going up from there depending on research required and complexity of implementation.

## Migrations

Migrations entail moving any type of service or offering from one state to another, and is often combined with Implementations.
 - These are often upgrading and replacing Server hardware
 - Replacing Firewalls, Switches, and Wireless hardware
 - This also encompass migrations of cloud providers and associated services.
 As these process are typically more involved than Implementations, due to the need of more documentation and change management processes this service starts 150$/hour

## Modernization

This service is a little more nuanced than the first two, in that there will be more stakeholder engagement to ensure all parties are able to come to an agreement on the solutions required.  Typically Modernizations involve identifying pain-points, bottlenecks and frequent issues, the end goal being removing as many blockers and obstacles to ensure and easy and seamless experience for your business needs.  
- One of the most common Modernization practices is working to enable SSO with more of your business applications to reduce the number of discrete passwords staff need to keep track of, enabling easier auditing and change management.
- Another common Modernization is reviewing your Processes and Policies, ensuring that they're up to date with your present environment, as there is always some drift as Services and Operating Systems update over time.
- Enabling tighter integration with your core services
The price for this service is highly dependant on your specific environments and needs.

## Consulting and Fractional Services

Consultation and Fractional Services are highly Client driven and are often a combination of all of the above services wrapped into highly integrated Corporate Initiatives such as:
- Quarterly or Semi-Annual Technical reviews of patching, security, budgeting and forecasting
- Insurance or Regulatory Compliance Objectives
- Ensuring Existing Solutions are still Optimal, properly utilized, or need to be expanded
- Co-Management with other providers
- AD-HOC support for Internal Infrastructure
Once again due to the highly variable and customized requirements, the price of this service is dependant on your specific needs.  Fractional services are provided on a retainer basis.
